<a id="cruz_info" href="#" class="link">Pastor Rafael Cruz</a> will share his story of achieving the American 
dream.  After immigrating to the United States as a teenager, Pastor Cruz graduated from the 
University of Texas and went on to work for IBM as well as start his own business in oil and 
gas data.  After losing everything in the crash of the 1980s, his relationship with Jesus 
Christ led him to do business in a new way and to train others to use the word of God as 
their guide and platform for their business.  Join us as he shares his life story and inspires 
others to exercise the freedoms that only America offers.<p />

<a id="Cruz"><p style="font-weight:bold;">About Pastor Cruz:</p>
Rafael Cruz is a powerful example of the American Dream. Born in Cuba, Rafael lived and suffered under a cruel, oppressive 
dictator. He began fighting Batista's regime as a teenager and was imprisoned and tortured simply because he wanted to be free.<p />
Rafael arrived in Texas in 1957 with nothing but the clothes on his back and one hundred dollars sewn into his underwear. 
He got a job as a dishwasher, making 50 cents an hour, and worked his way through the University of Texas, while learning English. 
He later built a small business in further pursuit of the American Dream.<p />
Rafael Cruz became active in conservative politics as a grassroots activist during the 1980 Presidential Campaign of Ronald Reagan. 
He is an ordained minister, sharing the Word of God in churches and Pastors Conferences throughout the United States. He is also the 
president of Kingdom Translation Services.<p />
His son, Ted Cruz, is the newly elected U.S. Senator from Texas. When Ted was a child growing up in Houston, Rafael would tell him, 
"When we faced oppression in Cuba, I had a place to flee to. If we lose our freedom here, where do we go?"<p />
That's why Ted Cruz ran for the U.S. Senate - to defend our freedom. And conservatives across Texas and the country united 
behind his campaign to elect a proven constitutional conservative to the U.S. Senate who won't abandon his principles.<p />
